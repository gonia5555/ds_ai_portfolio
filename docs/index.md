    <p style="margin: 0;">
      My name is <strong>Małgorzata Osmęda</strong>.
      I am a <strong>Polish professional who has been living in Spain for the past 18 years</strong>.
      Although I spent most of my professional life working in the <strong>tourism industry</strong>,
      at the <strong>beginning of 2025</strong> I encountered <strong>data analysis</strong> for the first time.
      This field quickly captured my attention and turned into a true passion.
    </p>

    <p style="margin: 0;">
      Since then, I have been <strong>working every day to expand my knowledge and strengthen my analytical and technical skills</strong>,
      driven by curiosity, persistence, and a strong motivation to grow in the data field, with a particular focus on
      <strong>data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence</strong>.
